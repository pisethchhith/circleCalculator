# Circle Calculator
#### Description
A calculator that can calculate the Area of Circle by entering Radius and Diameter.

Imagine you want to find Area of Circle without calculate it by hand and type multiple things on calculator. So that why's this problem inspires me to bulid this project with python based on my knowledge I took course from CS50P

What is special about this project? Well, it automatically converts any unit into meter by itself, because the Area
of Circle unit that I determined only square of meter (m^2) so that require meter as radius and diameter, and it also has animation too, which is cool btw :).
